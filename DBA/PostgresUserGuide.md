# Learning PostgreSQL

## Chapter 1: Relational Databases

introduces relational database system concepts, including relational database properties, relational algebra, and database modeling. Also, it describes different database management systems such as graph, document, key value, and columnar databases.

## Chapter 2: PostgreSQL in Action

provides first-hand experience in installing the PostgreSQL server and client tools on different platforms. This chapter also introduces PostgreSQL capabilities, such as out-of-the-box replication support and its very rich data types.

## Chapter 3: PostgreSQL Basic Building Blocks

provides some coding best practices, such as coding conventions, identifier names, and so on. This chapter describes the PostgreSQL basic building blocks and the interaction between these blocks, mainly template databases, user databases, tablespaces, roles, and settings. Also, it describes basic data types and tables.

## Chapter 4: PostgreSQL Advanced Building Blocks

introduces several building blocks, including views, indexes, functions, user-defined data types, triggers, and rules. This chapter provides use cases of these building blocks and compares building blocks that can be used for the same case, such as rules and triggers.

## Chapter 5: SQL Language

introduces Structured Query Language (SQL) which is used to interact with a database, create and maintain data structures, and enter data into databases, change it, retrieve it, and delete it. SQL has commands related to Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Control Language (DCL). Four SQL statements form the basis of DML—SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE—which are described in this chapter.

The SELECT statement is examined in detail to explain SQL concepts such as
grouping and filtering to show what SQL expressions and conditions are and how
to use subqueries. Some relational algebra topics are also covered in application to
joining tables.

## Chapter 6: Advanced Query Writing

describes advanced SQL concepts and features, such as common table expressions and window functions. This helps you implement a logic that would not be possible without them, such as recursive queries. Other techniques explained here, such as the DISTINCT ON clause, the FILTER clause, or lateral subqueries, are not that irreplaceable. However, they can help make a query smaller, easier, and faster.

## Chapter 7: Server-Side Programming with PL/pgSQL, describes PL/pgSQL

It introduces function parameters, such as the number of returned rows, and function cost, which is mainly used by the query planner. Also, it presents control statements such as conditional and iteration ones. Finally, it explains the concept of dynamic SQL and some recommended practices when using dynamic SQL.

## Chapter 8: PostgreSQL Security

discusses the concepts of authentication and authorization. It describes PostgreSQL authentication methods and explains the structure of a PostgreSQL host-based authentication configuration file. It also discusses the permissions that can be granted to database building objects such as schemas, tables, views, indexes, and columns. Finally, it shows how sensitive data, such as passwords, can be protected using different techniques, including one-way and two-way encryption.

## Chapter 9: The PostgreSQL System Catalog and System Administration Functions

provides several recipes to maintain a database cluster, including cleaning up data,
maintaining user processes, cleaning up indexes and unused databases objects,
discovering and adding indexes to foreign keys, and so on.

## Chapter 10: Optimizing Database Performance

discusses several approaches to optimize performance. It presents PostgreSQL cluster configuration settings, which are used in tuning the whole cluster's performance. Also, it presents common mistakes in writing queries and discusses several approaches to increase performance, such as using indexes or table partitioning and constraint exclusion.

## Chapter 11: Beyond Conventional Data types

discusses several rich data types, including arrays, hash stores, and documents. It presents use cases as well as operations and functions for each data type. Additionally, it presents full-text search.

## Chapter 12: Testing

covers some aspects of the software testing process and how it can be applied to databases. Unit tests for databases can be written as SQL scripts or stored functions in a database. There are several frameworks that help us write unit tests and process the results of testing.

## Chapter 13: PostgreSQL JDBC

introduces the JDBC API. It covers basic operations, including executing SQL statements and accessing their results as well as more advanced features such as executing stored procedures and accessing the metainformation of databases and tables.

## Chapter 14: PostgreSQL and Hibernate

covers the concept of Object-Relational Mapping, which is introduced using the Hibernate framework. This chapter explains how to execute CRUD operations in Hibernate and fetch strategies and associative mappings and also covers techniques such as caching and pooling for performance optimization.
