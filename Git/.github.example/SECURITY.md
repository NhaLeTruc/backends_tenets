# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately:

- Email: security@example.com
- PGP key: (optional) 0xDEADBEEF

We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and provide a remediation timeline. Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it is fixed.
