# Additional Git hook types and extension points (continued)

Below are lesser‑covered hook types and related extension points, plus practical notes on packaging, environment, and tooling. This continues the earlier reference and focuses on hooks and interfaces not detailed previously.

## Special-purpose / less common hooks

- **fsmonitor-watchman (fsmonitor)**
  - Purpose: accelerate Git status/index operations by integrating with file system watchers (e.g., Watchman).
  - How it works: Git calls a configured fsmonitor helper to get a list of changed files instead of scanning the whole working tree.
  - Use case: very large repos where `git status` / index operations are expensive.
  - Note: configured via `core.fsmonitor` / `core.fsmonitorwatchman`; helper implementation varies by platform.

- **sendemail-validate**
  - Purpose: run by `git send-email` to validate outgoing patch series before sending.
  - Use case: ensure patch metadata, sign-offs, or format are correct for mailing-list workflows.
  - Input: operates on the set of patches being sent; exit non-zero to abort.

- **post-index-change (integration point)**
  - Purpose: not standard in all Git installs but exposed by some extensions to react when the index changes.
  - Use case: editors/IDEs or tooling that need to react to index updates.
  - Note: availability varies; prefer `post-checkout`/`post-commit`/`pre-commit` for portable behavior.

- **pack-objects / pre-tx hooks (advanced server internals)**
  - Purpose: internal extension points called during packing or transactional ref updates on the server.
  - Use case: custom server-side constraints, special storage backends, advanced mirroring.
  - Note: typically only for advanced git-server customizations.

## Integration points vs hooks

- **Webhooks (hosting platforms: GitHub/GitLab)**
  - Distinct from Git hooks: sent by the hosting platform after push/PR events.
  - Use for CI triggers, notifications, sync processes — prefer for async server-side work.

- **Server-side hooks vs hosting provider policies**
  - On hosted platforms you may not be able to run arbitrary server hooks; use branch protection, Actions, or platform webhooks to enforce rules.

## Environment & inputs for hooks (robust implementation notes)

- Working directory: hooks run with repository root as CWD.
- Common env vars: GIT_DIR, GIT_WORK_TREE, GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_COMMITTER_NAME, etc.
- Hook arguments and stdin:
  - `commit-msg` / `prepare-commit-msg`: receive path to message file.
  - `pre-push`: receives remote name and URL as args; refs on stdin (lines: old new ref).
  - `pre-receive` / `post-receive`: refs on stdin (oldrev newrev refname).
  - `update`: three args (refname, oldrev, newrev).
- Exit codes: `0` = success; non-zero = abort the operation.

## Packaging and distributing hooks

- Use `core.hooksPath`
  - Store hooks in a versioned directory (e.g., `.githooks/`) and set `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` so contributors use the same hooks.
- Hook installers
  - Provide a setup script or `make dev-setup` that installs hooks or sets `core.hooksPath`.
- Cross-platform considerations
  - Use portable scripting (POSIX shell, Python, or compiled binaries); ensure Windows support (PowerShell or Git Bash).
  - Normalize line endings and executable bits for Windows contributors.

## Hook frameworks & integrations

- Pre-commit frameworks (pre-commit.org), Husky, Lefthook:
  - Manage many linters/formatters and simplify local installation.
- Prefer CI enforcement for heavy checks:
  - Fast client hooks for quick feedback; run expensive/authoritative checks in CI or server-side with clear failure messages.

## Testing and debugging hooks

- Test locally by invoking hooks with expected args and sample stdin.
- Provide verbose failure messages with remediation steps and exact commands to reproduce CI checks locally.
- Avoid side effects in blocking hooks; log to files or spawn background jobs when necessary.

## Security and robustness

- Validate inputs (stdin/args) to avoid command injection.
- Keep hooks idempotent and fast; otherwise developers will bypass them with `--no-verify`.
- Do not embed secrets in hooks; read secrets from secure stores at runtime if needed.

## Recommendations summary

- Use fsmonitor only when necessary and test across developer platforms.  
- Prefer pre-commit frameworks for multi-language linting/formatting and make CI authoritative.  
- Package hooks in-repo and provide an installer or set `core.hooksPath`.  
- Use hosting platform safeguards (branch protection, Actions) for enforcement where server hooks aren't available.  
- Provide clear failure messages and templates so developers can fix issues locally and avoid bypassing hooks.

If you want, I can generate example hook templates (portable shell, Python, or a small compiled helper) or a simple installer script for `.githooks/`.
