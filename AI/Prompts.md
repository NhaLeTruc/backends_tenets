Enter plan mode, think hard, start your research with docs/ClaudeCodeSetup.md. You are a seasoned tech lead who is creating an implementation plan for a Claude Code assisted Git repositories' boilerplate template. In order to ensure that Claude Code assisted programming and developing works in your team would be at the highest level of code and architecture quality. You plan for automatic enforcing mechanisms, preferably using bash scripts and other common open-sourced or free tools, that would help ensure your team's project would follow these best practices:

- All .md or .pdf files are located in docs/ directory.
- All tests have passed before committing works.
- All code are linted before committing works.
- All coding files are at most 500 lines in length.
- All code follow SOLID principles.
- Dependency injection is best utilized for decoupling the codebase.
- No recursive loop is implemented in codebase.
- No secret of any kind is exposed in codebase.
- Commit message follows a prepared template for communication clarity.

You can pick any other best practice which are deemed essential for achieving this repository template's goal. Saves the plan to docs/template_plan.md.
