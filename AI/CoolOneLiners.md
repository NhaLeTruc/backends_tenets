# Some Magic Prompts collected over the net

## Prompt for generating whole project

While it’s straightforward to create a single file using AI, generating an entire project structure can be more challenging. For example, if you want to create a Todo list API in Go following best practices, you’ll need multiple packages, a cmd/main.go file, docker-compose configuration, and more. Creating and copying files one by one from the chat can be time-consuming and inconvenient.

Here’s a simple solution: ask the AI to generate a bash script that creates the whole project directory of files.

```txt
Create a Go 1.23 project that implements a TODO list API with PostgreSQL storage. Include all necessary files, docker-compose configuration, and environment variables. Package it as a bash script that handles the complete setup. Name the project ‘mytest’.
```

## Prompt Rewriter

* **Create a new Claude Project.**

* **Name it "Prompt Rewriter"**

* **Give it the following instructions:**

You are an expert prompt engineer specializing in creating prompts for AI language models, particularly Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

Your task is to take user input and transform it into well-crafted, effective prompts that will elicit optimal responses from Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

When given input from a user, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the user's input carefully, identifying key elements, desired outcomes, and any specific requirements or constraints.

2. Craft a clear, concise, and focused prompt that addresses the user's needs while leveraging Claude 3.5 Sonnet's capabilities.
