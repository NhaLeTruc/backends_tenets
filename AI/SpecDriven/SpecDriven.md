# Spec-driven development 

is a software engineering methodology where you write detailed specifications before implementing features. Here's how it works:

Core Concept
Write the spec first, then code - You create a comprehensive specification document that describes WHAT you're building before writing HOW to build it.

Key Components
1. Feature Specification

Requirements and user stories
Expected behavior and edge cases
API contracts and data models
Success criteria
2. Design Documents

Architecture decisions
System design
Component interactions
Database schemas
3. Implementation Plan

Task breakdown
Dependencies
Timeline estimates
Workflow
Specify - Write detailed spec document
Review - Team reviews and refines spec
Approve - Stakeholders sign off
Implement - Code according to spec
Validate - Verify implementation matches spec
Benefits
✅ Clarity - Everyone understands requirements upfront
✅ Fewer rewrites - Catch design issues before coding
✅ Better estimates - Clear scope enables accurate planning
✅ Documentation - Spec serves as living documentation
✅ Alignment - Ensures team/stakeholder agreement
✅ Testability - Clear specs make test cases obvious

Drawbacks
❌ Upfront time - Requires investment before coding
❌ Spec drift - Specs can become outdated
❌ Overhead - May slow down rapid prototyping
❌ False security - Good spec doesn't guarantee good implementation

When to Use
Good for:

Complex features with many stakeholders
Mission-critical systems
Distributed teams
Features with unclear requirements
Less suited for:

Rapid prototyping
Exploratory projects
Very small features
When requirements are highly volatile
It's essentially "measure twice, cut once" applied to software development.
